# we-love-cake

A simple "days since cake was last had" app with Typescript and React.

I won't lie to you, it was a pain in the ass to get the most basic stuff working. Damn, this machine is picky!

To get it running, you would do something like:

    npm install -g typings
    npm install
    typings install
    npm run build
    open build/index.html
